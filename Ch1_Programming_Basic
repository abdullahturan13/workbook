In addition to associating names with constants, it is often useful to associate a name with a type. This association can be done with a **typedef** declaration. Rather than declaring a variable, a typedef defines a new type name.

```cpp
typedef char* BufferPtr; // type BufferPtr is a pointer to char
typedef double Coordinate; // type Coordinate is a double
BufferPtr p; // p is a pointer to char
Coordinate x, y; // x and y are of type double
```
